<i>Script Manager</i> is a simple application to create, import, edit and easily execute any properly formatted shell scripts.

<b>Please Note</b>

<i>Script Manager</i> doesn't need ROOT Access for normal use. However, due to the restricted permissions of android eco-system, executing root commands from app won't work without ROOT Access enabled.

<i>Script Manager</i> is a simple and very basic app, with a beautifully designed dark/light user interface, which offers the following things
* Create, edit, share, and easily execute shell scripts.
* Import shell scripts from sdcard.
* Apply scripts on boot, either on post-fs or late_service as per user choice (only if rooted with Magisk).
